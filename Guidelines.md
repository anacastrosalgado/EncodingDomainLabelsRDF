## Domain Labels - An Introduction

Domain labels are tags associated with individual lexicographic articles or senses in a dictionary or similar lexicographic resource which indicate that a lexical unit or a specific sense belongs to a specialised domain, e.g., Sport or Medicine. Dictionary domain labels can be organised in terms of taxonomies or thesauri, something which makes the original resource easier to navigate and to integrate with other datasets. Such labels play an important role in many lexicographic resources but there hasnâ€™t been much work on modelling these in linked data in a way that better exploits the possibilities of the Semantic Web stack.
